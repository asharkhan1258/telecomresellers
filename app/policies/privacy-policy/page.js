        </li>
      </ul>

        <li>To operate, secure, and improve this website.</li>
        <li>To meet legal, tax, and recordkeeping obligations.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How we share information</h2>
      <p>
        We share the information needed to act on your request with the specific

        laws that apply to your business and customers.
      </p>

      <h2>Data retention and security</h2>
      <p>
        We keep information for as long as needed to fulfill the purposes described
        above, resolve disputes, and meet legal obligations, then delete or anonymize
        it. We use reasonable administrative and technical safeguards, but no method
        of transmission or storage is completely secure.
